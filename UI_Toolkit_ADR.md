# Using React Native Elements for Frontend Design

## Status

The status of this AD is *accepted*
## Context

Our team has been evaluating various frontend UI toolkits that will assist in the development of our music streaming app. The goal is to choose a toolkit that will improve development efficiency without sacrificing quality.
## Decision

After consideration, we have decided to adopt React Native Elements. This is an all-in-one toolkit that provides a large library of components that will help us easily create a user-friendly interface.

**Reasoning:**
1. Supports theming:
	- React Native Elements supports theming which allows us to define an app theme and maintain consistent colors and typography.
2. Native integration with React Native:
	- Native integration will let us easily set up our app and implement a nice UI
3. Well Documented:
	- React Native Elements is a very popular open-source toolkit, and as such it has been well documented making it easy to understand and troubleshoot
4. Active community:
	- Because of it's popularity, React Native Toolkits has an active community that would be willing to provide any troubleshooting help

## Consequences

1. Large library:
	- React Native Elements is a super large library which may increase the size of the application
2. Limited customization:
	- While the library provides a plenty of components that can be customized, it may be difficult to design beyond what is provided in the pre-designed icons.
