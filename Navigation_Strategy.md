Navigation Strategy for Music Streaming App

## Status
The status of this ADR is *accepted*

## Context
After brainstorming the functionalities of our music streaming app, we have ascertained a few navigation strategies that will aid us in creating a streaming service that is enjoyable and easy to use.

## Decision
With this in mind, we can make decisions on what sort of navigation strategies we will be implementing. Some of these ideas will include search functionality as well as a hamburger menu. The functionalities and menus mentioned will also be designed in a specific way that allows users to understand what they do. For example, three parallel lines stacked on top of each other vertically is an international symbol for a menu.

**Search Functionality**:
1. Having the option to allow users to search through the app makes it easier for users to find exactly what they are looking for. With an intuitive design, it will be easy to decipher what the search bar does.

**Hamburger Menu**:
1. The hamburger menu allows for users to navigate through the app in an easy to understand way. With the hamburger menu, users can reach an array of tabs which are hidden by the menu icon and do not show up until it is needed.

## Consequences

**Hamburger Menu**:
1. An issue that may be encountered when using a hamburger menu is the amount of buttons that need to be pressed in order for the user to get where they want to go. If there are too many steps involved in using the app, then the users will lose interest and patience when using the application.
2. This can also mean that it hides important information for the user just off of first glance.
