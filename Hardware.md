# Title
Hardware required for Successful Music Streaming App

## Status
The status of this ADR is *pending*

## Context
In terms of hardware needed for *Dotify* to be successful, there was limited ideas that came to mind, as you will see later in this record.

## Decision
The primary, and perhaps only piece of hardware that is needed for *Dotify* would be a speaker/device to listen to your music, as well as a GPS utility which can allow for users to get notifications based on where they are.

**Device/Speaker**
1. The reasoning behind this selection is due to the fact that *Dotify* is a music streaming application that allows users to listen to music, which does not take much in terms of hardware. having a device to listen to your music on would be helpful for users to enjoy the app.

**GPS Utility**
1. The GPS utility will allow users to get notified in app about concerts or events relating to artists around you. This can mena that the users will know when a concert may be happening around them.

## Consequences

**Device/Speaker**
1. Users may not have a device to listen to their music on, whether that be a speaker, phone, or computer.

**GPS Utility**
1. The consequence of implementing GPS in *Dotify* will include security concers. This could be the case as allowing the app to know where you are can be valuble information and dangerous if it is not made secure.
